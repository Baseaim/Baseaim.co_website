## 3. ✅ Accessibility Enhancements

### Changes Made:

  </span>
  ```
- Screen readers now announce word changes every 3 seconds

#### Logo Carousel (`src/components/LogoCarousel.tsx`)
- **Added descriptive region label:**
  ```tsx
  <div role="region" aria-label="Our trusted AI technology partners">
  ```
- **Added `aria-live="off"`** to prevent continuous announcements during auto-scroll
- Provides context to screen reader users

#### MetricsBar Component
- Already had proper default values (~95%, ~300%, +45%)
- No changes needed - component was correctly implemented

### Impact:

## Testing Recommendations:

### Performance Testing:
1. Run Lighthouse audit (expect 90+ performance score)
2. Test on mobile devices with slower connections
3. Check Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console

### Social Sharing Testing:
1. Share URL on LinkedIn - verify preview image appears
2. Share URL on Twitter - verify Twitter Card renders
3. Use Facebook Debugger to validate OG tags

### Accessibility Testing:
1. Test with screen reader (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac)
2. Verify rotating headline announces properly
3. Check logo carousel doesn't over-announce

## Next Steps (Optional Future Improvements):

1. **Add canonical URL** if deploying to production domain
2. **Implement lazy loading** for below-fold images
3. **Add preconnect hints** for external font domains
4. **Consider using next/font** for better font optimization
5. **Add structured data** for local business schema (already have Organization schema)
